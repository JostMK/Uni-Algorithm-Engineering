## Compile

- Run ``make`` for building the project and running it without parameters; The program will prompt for needed inputs
- Run ``make e1`` for building the project and running it with the ``-e1`` flag for running exercise 1
- Run ``make e2`` for building the project and running it with the ``-e2`` flag for running exercise 2

## Exercise 1

Run ``./exercise-3 -e1 <optional number>`` to automatically select exercise 1 with the specified amount of elements in
the arrays.
If no number is specified the program will prompt for it.

## Exercise 2

Run ``./exercise-3 -e2 <optional path to movies.txt>`` to automatically select exercise 2 with the specified path as the
